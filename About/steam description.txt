[h1]Features[/h1]
• Train your colonist's melee and shooting skills by attacking combat dummies.
• Prioritize combat training like any other type of work.
• Train with real weapons or craft training weapons that cause no damage.  There is no friendly fire in either case.
• Add a combat dummy to a room to give that room the Combat Training Room role.

[h1]Usage[/h1]
1. Construct a combat dummy (or several).
  a. Combat dummies are located in the Misc tab.
2. Designate a combat dummy with the Train Combat designation.
  a. Select the combat dummy or dummies you want to designate for combat training and then click the train combat button or use the orders many to drag select several dummies
3. Open the work tab and make sure to prioritize Train Combat as desired
  a. Your colonist will use their currently equipped weapon to attack the dummies.
  b. Equip a training weapon to avoid damaging the combat dummies.  Training knives can be created at a craft spot and smithy, while training BB rifles need to be crafted at a machining table.

[h1]Balancing[/h1]
Combat training grants you about the same xp as actual combat.  This is balanced by making it a work type. Your colonists won't be doing any other work when training combat, plus it costs resources to create a dummy and training weapons.

[h1]Future Enhancements[/h1]

[b]Combat Training Weapon Racks[/b]
Weapons on combat training racks will allow colonists to equip the training weapons before they start training and re-equip their previous weapon when finished.

[b]Hit chance float window[/b]
Check hit chance by hovering over a combat dummy.
